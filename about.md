				All about Tinkering and Hacking Things around You

			<p>Guess what, you've come this far because you love to tinker and hack things. The saying "If it Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It" just doesn't apply here, because there is always room for improvements on everything you see around, like toys, computers, and electrical appliances. Oh man, life is too short not to tinker and hack all of those things!</p>
			<p>This website is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. The template was taken from <a href="https://github.com/brickgao/jekyll-pure">Jekyll-Pure</a> project by <a href="https://github.com/brickgao">Xiongzhi Gao</a>, with a lot of improvement here and there. The posting tag's CSS was taken from <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and those attractive icons were taken from <a href="http://fontawesome.io">Font Awesome</a>. The cartoon owl was designed by <a href="https://openclipart.org/detail/17566/cartoon-owl">lemmling</a> and <a href="https://openclipart.org/detail/168877/owl-with-notebook">bocian</a>, freely available from <a href="https://openclipart.org/">OpenClipart</a>.</p>
