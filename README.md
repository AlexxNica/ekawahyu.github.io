# ekawahyu.github.io
A blog based on (highly modified) [Jekyll-Pure](https://github.com/brickgao/jekyll-pure) by [Xiongzhi Gao](https://github.com/brickgao). This is still at its Alpha stage, but usable for simple blogging. Some added features are:

1. Post tagging, derived from Bootstrap-label.
2. Font Awesome ( [http://fontawesome.io/](http://fontawesome.io/) )

Feel free to contribute and optimize!
